Build the Kubernetes Lab from empty metal

[//]: # (Long Description)

[//]: # (A detailed description of the repo)

Uses Ansible to build an MVP controller, so that Cluster API and Tinkerbell can take over.

## Security
[//]: # (OPTIONAL)
[//]: # (May go here if it is important to highlight security concerns.)

Ansible uses obvious passwords, but these are replaced by SSH key auth once Kubernetes takes over.

## Background
[//]: # (OPTIONAL)
[//]: # (Explain the motivation and abstract dependencies for this repo)

Running your own metal has traditionally meant herding kittens. We wanted to keep the cloud native "feel", so it should
be as easy to replace a physical node as it is to replace a virtual one.

We, therefore, needed a way to provision that metal reliably and repeatably.

## Install

[//]: # (Explain how to install the thing.)
[//]: # (OPTIONAL IF documentation repo)
[//]: # (ELSE REQUIRED)

You will need,
- to install,
  - OpenTofu
  - Python3
  - Ansible
- A spare computer

## Usage
[//]: # (REQUIRED)
[//]: # (Explain what the thing does. Use screenshots and/or videos.)

To build the cluster from nothing,
1. Install Ubuntu server on a computer, setting the credentials to
    - Username: ubuntu
    - password: bootstrap
1. Connect all hosts to the kubernetes-lab VLAN
2. `cp .env.example .env` and add your real values to it.
1. run:

```shell
python3 bootstrap_runner
```

Your spare computer will go through the following stages,
1. Ansible will make it a Kubernetes Controller
2. Ansible will install Cluster API and Tinkerbell into the (currently single node) cluster.
3. Tinkerbell will provision the rest of the metal
4. Tinkerbell will reprovision the initial computer as a worker

From this point, Tinkerbell has ownership over all metal and is configured by Cluster API. This means we end up with
zero Ansible in use in our live cluster, which, from a "traditional" perspective, is remarkable.
